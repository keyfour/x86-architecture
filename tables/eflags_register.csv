11,OF,Overflow Flag,Status,"Set if the integer result is too large a positive number or too small a negative number (excluding the sign-bit) to fit in the destination operand; cleared otherwise. This flag indicates an overflow condition for signed-integer (twoâ€™s complement) arithmetic."
10,DF,Direction Flag,Control,"Setting the DF flag causes the string instructions to auto-decrement (to process strings from high addresses to low addresses). Clearing the DF flag causes the string instructions to auto-increment (process strings from low addresses to high addresses)."

7,SF,Sign Flag,Status,"Set equal to the most-significant bit of the result, which is the sign bit of a signed integer. (0 indicates a positive value and 1 indicates a negative value.)"
